# Poetry Slam
This project is a python program that will read from a file the poem called Woman Work by Maya Angelou. After reading it and storing this poem as a list it will perform a series of manipulations. Having the ends of printing this poem backwards, randomly and in a custom way. 

## Backwards 
For printing the poem backwards it was used reverse() function and also it was added the nomber of the line by its side. 

## Randomly
For this part we use the imported choice from the library called random. Using it we pick differents lines inside the peom and printed it.

## Custom way
For this part I choose to rearrenge the poem and display it with the lines that have more e's in it first and the ones that have less e's will go last. It will go from top to bottom of the poem so will print it in that order.
